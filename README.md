Description of project: Dynamical changes have been tracked from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging when a person is conscious but not carrying out a directed task during scanning. These diverse dynamical states are believed to represent different internal states of the brain, in terms of brain-regional interactions. An elusive goal of computational neuroscience is to describe the brain as a dynamical system with a predictable natural temporal evolution and response to input. Such a models would be invaluable to clinicians as a generalizable tool for identifying optimal brain stimulation approaches to drive the brain from various states of disease to states of health. Here, we sought to leverage resting-state fMRI to derive brain states that could be used to classify individuals with ADHD, Bipolar, and Schizophrenia compared to healthy controls using the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics LA5c Study.
